# Visualizer & Debugger for Comp250 Assignment 3 @ McGill University

# What does it do
This tester provides a visual interface for interacting with your binary tree. More feaures for automated testing to be added. Have fun!

# Installation
## Note on Latest Update:
In your source code for CatTree.java, you must change <code>CatTreeIterator</code> to either protected or public for this tester to compile in the latest version. If you do not want to do this, please install a version [before commit 29](https://github.com/TheBigSasha/COMP250_A3_W2020_PUBLISHED_DEBUGGER/tree/32b854e9fbbb39edaccd4a054008e74317acd426).

## Installation: Standard Method

Clone this repository to your directory of choice.
Add your assignment .java files <code>CatTree.java, CatInfo.java</code> and any of your own classes to the <code>COMP250_A3_W2020</code> package, in the location of <code>Put Your java files here.txt</code>

## Installation: Submodule Method

*This method is useful if you are managing your own git repository for this project and do not want to fork this one.* It allows you to maintain your existing workflow and still keep up to date with new versions of the visualizer.

IntelliJ Idea: Right click your project folder -> open in terminal -> enter command: <code>git submodule add https://github.com/TheBigSasha/COMP250_A3_W2020_PUBLISHED_DEBUGGER</code>

Other IDE on Linux / Mac: Open terminal. CD your project directory, enter command: <code>git submodule add https://github.com/TheBigSasha/COMP250_A3_W2020_PUBLISHED_DEBUGGER</code>

Other IDE on Windows: [Install Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) Follow steps for Linux/Mac using Git Bash.


### Note Regarding installation:
It is important that you use this repository as the folder structure for use of this debugger. It may work if you drag <code>CViz.java, RandomCats.java</code> and associated .form files into your project, but it is not likely to work across both IntelliJ and Eclipse.
